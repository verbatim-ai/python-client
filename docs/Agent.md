# Agent

Setup driving a RAG query: how wide the retrieval goes, whether results are re-ranked, what system instruction the model receives, how much history is replayed, and which models answer.  Two kinds of agent are returned by the same endpoints. **Core** agents belong to the platform, are visible to every organization and carry `lock: true` — they cannot be created, updated or deleted. **Custom** agents carry your `orgId`, `lock: false`, and are yours to manage.  Nullable fields are *overrides*, not copies. `null` means \"use the platform default\", so a default that is retuned later moves every agent that never set one. `systemInstruction` is read-only and shows the instruction those resolved values actually produce. 

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**id** | **UUID** | Unique identifier of the agent (UUIDv4). | 
**name** | **str** | Human-readable name of the agent. | 
**description** | **str** | Free-form description of what this agent is for. | [optional] 
**lock** | **bool** | Read-only. &#x60;true&#x60; for a core agent: shared across the platform and not writable. Attempting to update or delete one answers &#x60;400&#x60;. | 
**top_k** | **int** | Chunks the vector search returns, before re-ranking narrows them down. | 
**rerank** | **bool** | Whether the retrieved chunks are re-ranked by an LLM before the answer is generated. Re-ranking also needs &#x60;rerankModel&#x60;; with none set the flag has nothing to run. | 
**rerank_top_k** | **int** | Chunks kept after re-ranking. &#x60;null&#x60; uses the platform default. | [optional] 
**context** | **str** | First third of the system instruction — what the model is looking at. &#x60;null&#x60; uses the platform default. | [optional] 
**behaviour** | **str** | Second third of the system instruction — how the model should act. &#x60;null&#x60; uses the platform default. | [optional] 
**spirit** | **str** | Last third of the system instruction — the tone it should take. &#x60;null&#x60; uses the platform default. | [optional] 
**use_history** | **bool** | When &#x60;false&#x60;, previous posts of the session are not replayed and do not widen the embedded query — every question is answered on its own. | 
**history_size** | **int** | Number of trailing posts replayed. &#x60;null&#x60; replays the whole session. | [optional] 
**thinking_mode** | **str** | Reasoning budget the model is asked to spend before answering. | 
**temperature** | **float** | Model temperature. &#x60;null&#x60; leaves the model default untouched. Temperature must match model range. | [optional] 
**rerank_model** | **str** | Model used for re-ranking, as advertised by &#x60;GET /v1/config/model&#x60;. | [optional] 
**base_model** | **str** | Model used to generate the answer, as advertised by &#x60;GET /v1/config/model&#x60;. &#x60;null&#x60; keeps whatever model the session was created with. | [optional] 
**created_at** | **datetime** | Creation timestamp (ISO-8601, UTC). | 
**updated_at** | **datetime** | Last update timestamp (ISO-8601, UTC). Equal to &#x60;createdAt&#x60; on creation. | 
**default** | **bool** | Read-only. &#x60;true&#x60; on the single agent the platform falls back to when a query names none. At most one agent carries it. | 

## Example

```python
from verbatim_client.models.agent import Agent

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of Agent from a JSON string
agent_instance = Agent.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(Agent.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
agent_dict = agent_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of Agent from a dict
agent_from_dict = Agent.from_dict(agent_dict)
```
